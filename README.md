# CPSC-Project-2
Eduardo Casas, Ismail Hasan

IMPORTANT: ( we have 3 files one for each problem. The first two files are in c++ while the last file is in python)

How to run our code:
Method one(easy)
- Go online to https://www.onlinegdb.com there you can copy and paste our code on to the text editor.
- On the top right of the screen you can chanmge what language you would like to run (This is usefull since our first two files are in c++ and our last file is in python)
- After you copy paste a file and choose the correct language you click on run and you will be given a terminal to input as well as view the output.

Method two:
You can can use visual studios to run our code as well.
- create a new file on visual studios
- make sure you have both python and c++ downloaded on visual studios
- then paste our code into blank file. 
- run it with out debugging and you should be asked for user input and the output will be displayed.
